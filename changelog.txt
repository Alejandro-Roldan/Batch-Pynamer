V. 02.05:

	- Changed the visuals of the extended regular expression window so it's consistent with the rest of the program
	- Extended the treeviews to fill the whole horizontal space
	- Metadata modules are now optional to run the program. If they are not installed you are still able to use the rest of the functionalities
