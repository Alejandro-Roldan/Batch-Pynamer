V. 04:
	- Changed project name to "Batch Pynamer"
	- Added the ability to rename files using metadata values
	- Added function to set the metadata's title and tracknumber from the filename (splits the filename at the first apparition of "-" and sets the first part to be the tracknumber and the second to be the title)
	- Added File Menu Function to set the title and the tracknumber metadata
	- Now when applying changes to the metadata it automatically reloads

	To do:
		- Add metadata changes for images and videos

V. 03.05:
	- Added the ability to open the program in a specific folder calling it with the folder as an argument
	- Set up a default PATH constant to fallback
	- Changed path.split('/') to os.path.basename() and os.path.dirname() accordingly (which also allows to use in windows)

V. 03:
	- Added the function to format the tracknumber metadata field to remove anything after "/" (inclusive) and add 0s left pading to have 2 digits
	- Added File Menu Function to format the tracknumber
	- Added ability to create new metadata tags
	- Added Error Handling for ID3 when the tag doesn't have an valid name
	- Ordered functions in new groups that make more sense

V. 02.08:
	- Changed the configuration folder path to have a "/" at the end
	- Fixed bug where the file menu option "Refresh Tree" would just empty the tree instead of refreshing it
	- Fixed bug where you wouldn't be able to use the rename application without the metadata imports caused by the options in the menu bar
	- Created Error class for trying to rename to an already existing file name

V. 02.07:
	- Changed Naming convention for the main file to just be BatchRenamerpy.py
	- Added Menu Bar
	- Added File menu
	- Added Selection Menu
	- Added Comands support (saving, loading, chain commands and applying directly)
	- Added About menu button

	- Added Undo Name Changes functionality
	- Added Error Pop Up window
	- Added several error handlings when there is no selection and corresponding info msgs
	- Added code comments

V. 02.06:
	- Fixed bug where the spinbox that should begin at 1 would initialize at 0. I have solved it for my program by adding a line right after creation that sets them to 1, but it's something that the tkinter developers should fix themselves. Now I remember that's why I used tk.spinbox instead of ttk.spinbox
	- Made the metadata tab extend across the whole horizontal space
	- Made the labels in the metadata entry list not exceed a certain size
	- Added Info Bar Message when you refresh the folder navigation treeview
	- Added Info Bar Message when you copy a file path with right click over it
	- Added code comments

V. 02.05:
	- Now it's possible to change MP3s metadata too
	- Fixed bug that didn't let you open the extended regular expressions window
	- Changed the visuals of the extended regular expression window so it's consistent with the rest of the program
	- Extended the treeviews to fill the whole horizontal space
	- Metadata modules are now optional to run the program. If they are not installed you are still able to use the rest of the functionalities
	- Untabbed comments where necessary so they don't hide when automatic code folding (a bit of a failure though, still folds the bullet points inside the comments)

V. 02:
	- Added a scrollbar for the metadata entries widget so when a file has many entries it doesn't make a bigger window
	- Added an entry at the top of the treeviews to see the path of the active folder and being able to access any folder writing its path and hiting return
	- Added a button to refresh the folder treeview at will
	- Got rid of "from tkinter import *" for a better "import tkinter as tk"
	- Removed extra imports that weren't being used
	- Changed spinboxes from tk to ttk so they use the same color pallette as the rest of the program
	- Extended the info bar across the whole window horizontally

V. 01.02:
	- Added an info bar at the bottom to show number of items and number of selected items plus a last action message
