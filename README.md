# Batch-Renamer-py
A purely python batch file renamer specially made to work on linux

It can also change audio files metadata for flac and mp3 files. If you don't have the metadata dependencies needed you can still use the rest of the program, which uses exclusively base python libraries.

Probably the only changes needed to make it run on windows is change the PATH constant to a windows like path.
